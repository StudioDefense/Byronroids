This is an Asteroids clone I made for my stepdad as a Christmas present 2017. 
Has known bugs but functions fine.  
Uses all original Asteroids SFX and contains a theme song I made using those SFX.  
I tried to keep gameplay as true as a could to the original, 
major exceptions being that all the asteroids are now my stepdads face, and you can shoot rapid fire, 
which makes it pretty easy to get a good score.
